# Local Model Protocol

## Request Envelope

Every request sent to the local model contains:

- A concise system contract.
- The atomic task envelope.
- Only the necessary bounded tools.
- Explicit context and output budgets.
- `stream: false` for atomic responses.
- `think: false` (unless the task explicitly requests a reasoning trace).

Example Ollama request parameters:

```json
{
  "model": "qwen3-8b-q6k:latest",
  "stream": false,
  "think": false,
  "keep_alive": "10m",
  "options": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.8,
    "num_ctx": 8192,
    "num_predict": 512
  }
}
```

Active models and allocated VRAM are queried via `/api/ps`; models can be unloaded immediately using `/api/generate` with `keep_alive: 0`.

`options.num_ctx` specifies the context window size for each request. The controller enforces bounds between 1 and `max_context_length`.

## System Contract

```text
You are a local coding sub-agent assigned to a single atomic task.
Operate strictly within the provided task envelope.
Do not invent missing context or assumptions.
Do not claim to have run tests or modified files without tool evidence.
Use only the provided tools.
If data is missing, ask one precise question.
Patches must be minimal and modify only allowlisted files.
Return only the structured JSON result upon completion.
```

---

## Tool Loop Execution

1. Send task envelope and bounded tool schemas to the model.
2. If `tool_calls` are returned, preserve the assistant message in conversation history.
3. Execute each tool call through the controller policy layer.
4. Append tool execution results as `role: tool` messages with matching `tool_name`.
5. Re-query the model.
6. Terminate upon receiving a final JSON response, policy error, duplicate tool call, or exceeding `max_turns`.

Default task limits:
- `max_turns: 4`
- `max_same_call: 1`
- `max_tool_result_bytes: 32000`
- `max_files: 5`
- `max_patch_files: 2`

`TaskBudget` enforces bounded preflight checks on service and controller boundaries. Non-empty patches require at least one pre-allowlisted targeted check.

## Final Candidate Format

```json
{
  "status": "candidate",
  "summary": "Description of changes",
  "patch": "unified diff string",
  "edits": [
    {
      "file": "src/unique.py",
      "search": "old code block",
      "replace": "new code block"
    }
  ],
  "checks": [
    {
      "command": "pytest tests/test_unique.py",
      "passed": true,
      "evidence": "1 passed in 0.05s"
    }
  ],
  "risks": []
}
```

A candidate proposal contains either a `patch` (unified diff) or `edits` (SEARCH/REPLACE blocks), but never both. Test `checks` in the terminal result are populated strictly by the external test runner; model self-reports without runner evidence are rejected.

---

## SEARCH/REPLACE (`edits`)

Local models (7B–27B) frequently struggle with raw unified diffs due to line-counting and hunk header errors (`@@ -x,y +x,y @@`). The `edits` format removes this failure mode: the model copies the exact existing code block into `search` and provides the modified version in `replace`.

Rules:
- Each edit block is an object: `{"file": "path", "search": "...", "replace": "..."}`.
- `search` must match the file content character-for-character, occur exactly once, and align with line boundaries.
- If `search` is not found, appears multiple times, or is misaligned, the proposal is rejected with a machine-readable diagnostic error.
- The controller automatically converts valid `edits` into a unified diff and validates it with `git apply --check`.

---

## Mediated Apply & Auto-Rollback

Local models only propose changes via `propose_patch`; they cannot write directly to disk. When invoked with `--apply` or `apply_proposal`:

1. The controller validates applicability via `git apply --check`.
2. The patch is applied to the workspace.
3. All allowlisted targeted checks are re-executed against the modified workspace.
4. If all checks pass, the result receives `"applied": true`.
5. If any check fails, the patch is automatically rolled back, and the status is set to `"rejected"` with risk kind `post_apply_check_failed`.

---

## Process-Bound stdio Adapter

`StdioDelegationAdapter` accepts one UTF-8 JSONL command per line:

```json
{
  "method": "delegate_code",
  "caller_id": "trusted-host",
  "params": {
    "request_id": "opaque-idempotency-key",
    "workspace_ref": "registered-workspace",
    "model_profile": "qwen3-8b-q6k",
    "task": {
      "id": "refactor-func",
      "goal": "Refactor helper function",
      "files": ["src/helper.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

The adapter returns one UTF-8 JSONL response string matching the `DelegationService` response format.

---

## Retries & Escalation

Retries are only permitted when a specific, remediable failure reason occurs:
- `invalid_json`
- `patch_parse_failed`
- `file_outside_allowlist`
- `check_failed`
- `needs_context`

Repeating an identical request without altering context or constraints is prohibited.
